**Abstract:**
Our project entails the creation of a wireless network that communicates between vehicles and an interface within the vehicle to create an overall safer driving experience.  Our challenge is to make drivers more aware of their surroundings, while also reducing distractions. This challenge can be overcome by creating a family of embedded devices that can communicate with one another in order to notify drivers of potential hazardous situations that the devices and algorithms detect.  This will make roads a safer place by giving drivers real-time information updates from other vehicles in the network.  These warnings and messages will be displayed on an interface inside the car.

Vehicle interfaces are becoming increasingly complex, but this complexity has moved the driving experience away from the road and has created more distractions for the driver. Our project is to enhance the driver experience by making a simple interface which is concentrated in one region to reduce distractions and to create a safer driving experience. We will do this by creating an interface which allows the driver to focus on the road while being able to control all critical features of the car.
